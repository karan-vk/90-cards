## 90 cards problem

Question 1
There are 90 cards with all two-digit numbers on them: 

10,11,12,â€¦,98,99.
 

A player takes some of these cards simultaneously. For each card taken she gets $1. However, if the player takes two cards that add up to 100 (say, 23 and 77), she loses all the money. How much could she get? 

In mathematical language: What is the maximum number of two-digit integers (10,11,...,99) that one can select satisfying the following condition: no two different selected integers have sum 100?
